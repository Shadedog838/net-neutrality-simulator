<h1>Tom Brady Questionable vs. Jaguars; Limited in Practice with Hand Injury</h1>
<p id="pi">The New England Patriots have listed quarterback Tom Brady as questionable for Sunday's AFC Championship Game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Gillette Stadium because of a hand injury he suffered in Wednesday's practice.

The team announced his status Friday after he was a limited participant in the day's practice session.

New England, which is notoriously tight-lipped about injuries, hasn't shed much light on Brady's availability in recent days.

"Today is Friday," Pats head coach Bill Belichick told reporters when asked whether his starting QB would be a game-time decision Sunday.

"We'll see," Brady answered Friday when questioned about if he'd play against the Jags.
